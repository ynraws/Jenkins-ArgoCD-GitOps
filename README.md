## GitOps with Jenkins and ArgoCD

YouTube Video Link: https://youtu.be/xbxJpZcFT78

This repository demonstrates a GitOps workflow using Jenkins Container and ArgoCD to deploy Kubernetes manifests to a Minikube cluster running on a Container. The project integrates Jenkins CI/CD with ArgoCD to enable automated deployments whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

### Project Overview

Jenkins: Runs as a container outside the Minikube cluster to handle CI/CD tasks.

Minikube: Serves as the Kubernetes cluster, with Docker as the driver.

ArgoCD: Manages the continuous deployment of Kubernetes manifests.

GitHub Webhooks: Triggers the Jenkins pipeline upon git push events.

Manifests Directory: Contains Kubernetes YAML files for deployment, located in the manifests directory of this repository.


### Architecture

Git Push: Changes to the repository trigger a GitHub webhook.

Jenkins Pipeline: Jenkins fetches the updated repository and interacts with ArgoCD to deploy the manifests.

ArgoCD: Syncs the manifests with the Minikube cluster, ensuring the cluster state matches the desired configuration.


### Prerequisites

#### Setup

A GitHub repository with Kubernetes manifest files in a manifests directory.
